The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a small company that wanted to help students prepare for their driver’s license exam. The client needed a web-based application that would allow users to register and purchase learning packages, as well as take online practice exams. The goal was to create a reliable user-friendly system that integrates both online learning and instructor scheduling.
I believe I did well in defining the business requirements and translating them into clear and actionable system features. I ensured that the use cases were aligned with the client’s goal. My system design documents also illustrated how the different components would interact to form a cohesive solution

When I designed the system I focused on what the client needed instead of what they stated that they wanted. I broke down their goals into testable requirements. Understanding the client needs is critical because it keeps the system practical. A good design isn’t just about functionality. It is about asking the correct questions and solving the right problems.

My approach to system design is to start by understanding the problem and understanding how the system is actually intended to be used. From there I like to iterate through designs until the design feels like it accomplished all of the stated goals as well as the technical requirements that are ancillary to achieving the goals. I also try to keep the design as flexible as possible by keeping components modular and easy to extend functionality as the application grows.
